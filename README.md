# odin-js-project-1
Rock-Paper-Scissors

This project will consist of Javascript at its initial stages.
The goal is to recreate the game using script.
It will be played using a randomly generated choice from the computer and a user input using a window prompt.

The script is expected to follow the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors.
The script will loop until 5 Rounds and should keep a record of wins, losses, and ties.

! Finished @ 09/18/22 !

# UI
This project will now run by clicking on a 'start' button after picking one of the three choices in rock, paper, and scissors. The results such as scores and computer choices will be displayed and updated instead of being console logged.

The script is expected to display the use of DOM elements and the winning condition will be first to 5 wins without any limit to the number of rounds.
